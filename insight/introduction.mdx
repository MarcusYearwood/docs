# Insight

Insight is the observability component of Metis, providing comprehensive tracing and monitoring for your AI applications. It captures and visualizes the full execution flow of your LLM-powered systems.

## Overview

Insight automatically collects telemetry data from your AI applications using OpenTelemetry (OTel), giving you visibility into:

- **Trace visualization** - See the complete execution flow of your AI agents
- **Token usage** - Track input, output, and total tokens across models
- **Cost monitoring** - Monitor API costs across providers
- **Latency analysis** - Identify performance bottlenecks
- **Error tracking** - Debug failed requests and exceptions

## How It Works

Insight leverages the OpenTelemetry standard to capture spans from your application. When you instrument your code with mantisdk's tracing module, telemetry is automatically collected and sent to Insight for analysis.

```python
import mantisdk.tracing as tracing

# Initialize and auto-instrument
tracing.init()
tracing.instrument()

# Your LLM calls are now traced automatically
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Instrumentation

Insight supports automatic instrumentation for popular LLM libraries through OpenInference:

- OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy
- Claude Agent SDK, CrewAI
- AWS Bedrock, Google VertexAI
- And many more

### Semantic Attributes

Insight recognizes and indexes [semantic attributes](/insight/attributes) from your traces, enabling rich filtering and analysis. These attributes are automatically extracted from instrumented libraries or can be set manually.

### Multi-Source Normalization

Insight normalizes telemetry from various sources:

- OpenInference conventions
- Vercel AI SDK
- OTel GenAI semantic conventions
- Custom span attributes

This means you get consistent data regardless of which instrumentation library you use.
