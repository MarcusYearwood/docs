## Installation

```bash
pip install mantisdk
```

## Core Concept

The foundation of mantisdk is **emitting rewards**:

```python
import mantisdk as msk

# After your agent completes a task, emit a reward
msk.emit_reward(0.85)  # Score between 0 and 1
```

This simple call captures your agent's performance and enables training algorithms to optimize it.
